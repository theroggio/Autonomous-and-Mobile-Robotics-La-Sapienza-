## Problem 11.1

First we think about the tricycle, it needs 4 generalized coordinates: x-position, y-position, angle wrt x axis of the chassis, angle of the steerable wheel wrt chassis orientation.

Then for each of the N trailers, we can establish the position of the center between the wheels from the x and y position of the chassis, knowing the orientation of the wheels wrt the orientation of the wheels / chassis of the tricycle. 

So for each one of the N trailers we just need the orientation coordinate. 

This means the final set of generalized coordinates is <img src="http://bit.ly/2VYODuU" align="center" border="0" alt="q= \begin{bmatrix}x & y & \phi & \theta_0 & ... & \theta_N \end{bmatrix} ^T" width="150" height="20" />.
